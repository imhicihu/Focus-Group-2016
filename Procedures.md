Processing:
+ Audio:
    * all the videos were extracted the sound. 
	* the sounds were treated and improved: i.e. noise reduction it was applied for better transcription.
+ Video:
    * all the sessions were recorded on HD.
	* from the internal hard drive of the video camcorder were moved to a macbook encripted. Moreover it was created a virtual machine (courtesy of VirtualBox), from where it were recorded to blank dvds for backup purpose.
	* Once recorded, it was delivered by hand to destination. 
	* The virtual machine was obliterated. 
	* Both portable hard drives were wipped.
